Pokedex
=======

This is an app made in Tcl and Tk. Currently there's nothing much as it's still a work in its initial phases. As I will add more features, the app will become larger and if I think there's something I can't do in Tcl, I might move everything over to Python and Tkinter (or something better if I find one).

What I have in mind for this Pokedex is from both a competitive perspective and a casual perspective.

For the time being, I'm implementing some basic features:
- Selecting a Pokemon,
- Viewing details of the Pokemon (including picture, name, species, gender encouter rate, movepool, stats, etc),
- Being able to view Pokemon from the different generations,

Things that I'm considering in no particular order:
- Basic search for Pokemon with input like specific stats, learnable moves, abilities.
- Basic search for items with input like effects, category.
- Basic search for abilities, moves with input like effect.
- Damage calculator
- Stat calculator
